Public geospatial data sets presented in formats commonly used by open-source tools. The greatest effort will be made to make data sets available in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) and [SpatiaLite](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/) formats. Larger polygon data sets may also be made available as [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki).
